# Catala english token proposals

## FIELD

Current proposal: "application field".

The logical context in which the text of the law will apply. Examples are
"computation of family benefits", "determination of child credit eligibility".

```
application field FamilyBenefitsComputation:
  ...
```

## DATA

Current proposal: "data".

When declaring a data structure, introduces a data field :

```
structure Foo:
  data bar ...
```

## CONTENT

Current proposal: "content".

Introduces type annotation for data.


```
data bar content boolean
```

## DEPENDS

Current proposal : "depends"

Introduces a dependency on a parameter for a piece of data when declaring
a structure.

```
  data bar depends on Foo
```

## DECLARATION

Current proposal : "declaration"

Declares a structure or a enumeration in the metadata section.

## INCLUDES

Current proposal "includes"

A FIELD can include another FIELD, building up code modularity which is also
present in statutes.

```
declaration application field FamilyBenefitsComputation:
   ...
includes application field HouseholdIncomeComputation
```

## CONTEXT

Current proposal : "context"

A FIELD has several parameters, which are the data in the logical context of the
FIELD. CONTEXT introduces these data.

```
declaration application field FamilyBenefitsComputation:
   context foo content FOO
```

Also introduces context matching when including another field:

```
  ...
includes application field HouseholdIncomeComputation:
   HouseholdIncomeComputation.household = FamilyBenefitsComputation.household
   ...
```

Used as function application token with a single parameter (foo of bar)

```
income of household
```

## COLLECTION

Current proposal: "collection"

```

## DATE

Current proposal : "date".

The base data type for representing dates.

```
data foo content date

## BOOLEAN

Current proposal : "boolean".

The base data type for representing booleans. Apparently lawyers don't know what
it is but I haven't found a better word.

```
data foo content boolean
```

## SUM

Current proposal: "sum".

Function for doing the sum of a quantity over a collection of data.

```
number for child in children of child.age > 15 year
```

## CONDITION

Current proposal: "condition"

eligible_for_credit fulfilled
```

## RULE

Current proposal: "rule"

Inside a FIELD, introduces a rules that sets a CONDITION to FILLED or not FILLED

application field FamilyBenefitsComputation:
  rule under condition
    number of household.children > 2
  consequence eligible filled
```

## DEFINITION

Current proposal: "definition".

Same thing as RULE but for data that is not a condition.

```
application field FamilyBenefitsComputation:
  definition income defined as
    sum for child in household.children of child.income
```

## DEFINED_AS

Current proposal: "defined as".

Introduces the expression of a data in a DEFINITION.

See above for example.

## MATCH

```

## CONSEQUENCE

Current proposal: "consequence"

## IF THEN ELSE

Current proposal: "if" "then" "else"
