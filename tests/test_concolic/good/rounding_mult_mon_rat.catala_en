Test that the rounding scheme for multiplication of money by decimal is the
same in Z3 and OCaml.

```catala
declaration scope A:
    input x content money
    output o content integer

scope A:
    exception definition o under condition (x = $1 * -0.015)
        consequence equals 0
    exception definition o under condition (x = $1 * -0.011 and x = $1 * -0.005)
        consequence equals 1
    exception definition o under condition (x = $1 * -0.001
                                            and x = $1 * -0.000
                                            and x = $1 * 0.001)
        consequence equals 2
    exception definition o under condition (x = $1 * 0.005 and x = $1 * 0.011)
        consequence equals 3
    exception definition o under condition (x = $1 * 0.015)
        consequence equals 4

    definition o equals -1
```
