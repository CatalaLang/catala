# Catala test suite

This folder contains Catala source files designed to test the features of the
language.

Tests are declared inside plain Catala files with the following format:

~~~markdown
```catala-test-inline
$ catala ARGS
... output from the catala command ...
```
~~~

## Workflow for adding new tests

1. Create a new test file in `foo/{good,bad}/bar.catala_<language>` (pick the right directory and
   an informative name for your test)
2. Write your test, and pick a toplevel scope `A` to run.
3. Add the following section to your file:
      ~~~markdown
      ```catala-test-inline
      catala Interpret -s A
      ```
      ~~~
4. Run `make tests/foo/{good,bad}/bar.catala_<language> CLERK_OPTS=--reset`
   from the root of the Catala repository. This will update the test with the
   actual output of the catala command.
5. Don't forget to `git add` the test file.

## Workflow for fixing regressions

1. Run `make test_suite` from the root of the Catala repository, if a test fails
   you should see something like
   `FAILED: foo/{good,bad}/bar.catala_<language>.out]` followed by the diff
   between the expected output and the current output of the command.
2. Debug the compiler and the test and repeat. Run
   `make tests/foo/{good,bad}/bar.catala_<language>` to check the test again.
3. When you're finished debugging, if you are positive that a change in the test
   output is legitimate, record the new outputs with
   `make tests/foo/{good,bad}/bar.catala_<language> CLERK_OPTS=--reset`.
4. Re-run `make test_suite` from the root of the Catala repository to check that
   everything passes.
5. Run `git diff` to double-check your changes to the test outputs are expected.
   If necessary, justify them in your commit message.

If a compiler change causes a lot of regressions (error message formatting changes
for instance), you can mass-reset the expected outputs with
`make test_suite CLERK_OPTS=--reset`.
`git diff` will then allow to check all the changes at once.
**Caution**: It's your responsability to check all the changes before committing them.
