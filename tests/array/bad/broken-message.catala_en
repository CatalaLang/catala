```catala
declaration scope A:
  output x content list of money
  output y content list of decimal

scope A:
   definition x equals [$12; $13.50; $11; $100.1; $50.20]
   definition y equals [1.0; 2.0; 3.0; 4.0; 5.9]

declaration scope B:
  a scope A
  output reverse content list of money
  output ratios1 content (list of money, money)

scope B:
  definition reverse equals
    # Only this case was changed compared to `fold.catala_en`
    combine all x among a.x in acc initially [$0] with
      x ++ acc
   #  ^ Error should be here (money, while expected list because of `++`)

  definition ratios1 equals
    combine all x among a.x in (acc1, acc2) initially ([], $1) with
      (acc1 ++ [x + acc2], acc2 + x)
```

There was an error -- now fixed -- where the issue was pointed on `x+acc2` with
a confusing message.

This was diagnosed to be due to delayed error messages that got skipped.
