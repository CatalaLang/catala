scope A:
  definition x equals |2022-01-16|
  definition y under condition get_year of x < 2010 consequence equals true
  definition y under condition get_year of x >= 2010 and get_year of x < 2015 consequence equals false
  definition y under condition get_year of x >= 2015 and get_year of x <= 2020 consequence equals true
