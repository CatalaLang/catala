```catala
scope Closure_scøppe:
  rule scoppe under condition for all x among [ 5; 6; 7 ] we have x > 2
  consequence fulfilled
```

Here we crafted the rule so that a closure will be lifted with a name that
clashes with the scope names ; but such clashes could also happen from other
definitions of private scopes or toplevel definitions.

The addition of this rule should *not* lead to a change in the names of the
symbols that will be exported: the final `register_module` should be the same
below and above (otherwise, users of the module would end up calling the wrong
function!)
