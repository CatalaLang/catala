```catala
declaration scope S:
  context f content integer depends on x content integer
  context b content boolean
  context output out content integer

declaration scope R:
  s scope S
  context output r content integer

scope S:
  definition f of x under condition (x >= x) consequence equals x + x
  definition f of x under condition not b consequence equals x * x
  definition b equals false
  definition out equals f of 5

scope R:
  definition s.f of x equals x + x * x
  definition r equals s.out
```

```catala-test-inline
$ catala test-scope R
[RESULT] Computation successful! Results:
[RESULT] r = 30
```

Note: ideally this could use test-scope but some positions are lost during translation to lcalc

```catala-test-inline
$ catala interpret -s S
