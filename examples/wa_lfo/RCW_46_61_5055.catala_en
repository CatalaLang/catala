  46.61.504 and who has no prior offense within seven years shall be punished as
  follows:
  (a) Penalty for alcohol concentration less than 0.15. In the case of a person
  whose alcohol concentration was less than 0.15, or for whom for reasons other
  than the person's refusal to take a test offered pursuant to RCW 46.20.308 there
  is no test result indicating the person's alcohol concentration:
    (i) By imprisonment for not less than one day nor more than three hundred
    sixty-four days. Twenty-four consecutive hours of the imprisonment may not be
    suspended unless the court finds that the imposition of this mandatory minimum
    sentence would impose a substantial risk to the offender's physical or mental
    well-being. Whenever the mandatory minimum sentence is suspended, the court
    shall state in writing the reason for granting the suspension and the facts upon
    which the suspension is based. In lieu of the mandatory minimum term of
    imprisonment required under this subsection (1)(a)(i), the court may order not
    less than fifteen days of electronic home monitoring or a ninety-day period of
    24/7 sobriety program monitoring. The court may consider the offender's pretrial
    24/7 sobriety program monitoring as fulfilling a portion of posttrial
    sentencing. The offender shall pay the cost of electronic home monitoring. The
    county or municipality in which the penalty is being imposed shall determine the
    cost. The court may also require the offender's electronic home monitoring
    device or other separate alcohol monitoring device to include an alcohol
    detection breathalyzer, and the court may restrict the amount of alcohol the
    offender may consume during the time the offender is on electronic home
    monitoring; and
    (ii) By a fine of not less than three hundred fifty dollars nor more than
    five thousand dollars. Three hundred fifty dollars of the fine may not be

  refusal to take a test offered under RCW 46.20.308 there is no test result
  indicating the person's alcohol concentration:
    (i) Where there has been no prior offense within seven years, be suspended
    or denied by the department for ninety days or until the person is evaluated
    by an alcoholism agency or probation department pursuant to RCW 46.20.311
    and the person completes or is enrolled in a ninety-day period of 24/7
    sobriety program monitoring. In no circumstances shall the license
    suspension be for fewer than two days;
    (ii) Where there has been one prior offense within seven years, be revoked
    or denied by the department for two years or until the person is evaluated
    by an alcoholism agency or probation department pursuant to RCW 46.20.311

    sobriety program monitoring. In no circumstances shall the license
    suspension be for less than one year; or
    (iii) Where there have been two or more prior offenses within seven years,
    be revoked or denied by the department for three years;
  (b) Penalty for alcohol concentration at least 0.15. If the person's alcohol
  concentration was at least 0.15:
    (i) Where there has been no prior offense within seven years, be revoked or
    denied by the department for one year or until the person is evaluated by an
    alcoholism agency or probation department pursuant to RCW 46.20.311 and the

    (iii) Where there have been two or more prior offenses within seven years,

Upon receipt of a notice from the court under RCW 36.28A.390 that a participant has been removed from a 24/7 sobriety program, the department must resume any suspension, revocation, or denial that had been terminated early under this subsection due to participation in the program, granting credit on a day-for-day basis for any portion of a suspension, revocation, or denial already served under RCW 46.20.3101 or this section arising out of the same incident.
Upon its own motion or upon motion by a person, a court may find, on the record, that notice to the department under RCW 46.20.270 has been delayed for three years or more as a result of a clerical or court error. If so, the court may order that the person's license, permit, or nonresident privilege shall not be revoked, suspended, or denied for that offense. The court shall send notice of the finding and order to the department and to the person. Upon receipt of the notice from the court, the department shall not revoke, suspend, or deny the license, permit, or nonresident privilege of the person for that offense.
For purposes of this subsection (9), the department shall refer to the driver's record maintained under RCW 46.52.120 when determining the existence of prior offenses.

(11) Conditions of probation. (a) In addition to any nonsuspendable and nondeferrable jail sentence required by this section, whenever the court imposes up to three hundred sixty-four days in jail, the court shall also suspend but shall not defer a period of confinement for a period not exceeding five years.

The court may impose conditions of probation that include nonrepetition, installation of an ignition interlock device on the probationer's motor vehicle, alcohol or drug treatment, supervised probation, or other conditions that may be appropriate. The sentence may be imposed in whole or in part upon violation of a condition of probation during the suspension period.
  (b) For each violation of mandatory conditions of probation under (a)(i),
  (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this subsection, the court shall order the
  convicted person to be confined for thirty days, which shall not be suspended
  or deferred.
  (c) For each incident involving a violation of a mandatory condition of
  probation imposed under this subsection, the license, permit, or privilege to
  drive of the person shall be suspended by the court for thirty days or, if
  such license, permit, or privilege to drive already is suspended, revoked, or
  denied at the time the finding of probation violation is made, the suspension,
  revocation, or denial then in effect shall be extended by thirty days. The
  court shall notify the department of any suspension, revocation, or denial or
  any extension of a suspension, revocation, or denial imposed under this
  subsection.
(12) Waiver of electronic home monitoring. A court may waive the electronic home monitoring requirements of this chapter when:
  (a) The offender does not have a dwelling, telephone service, or any other
  necessity to operate an electronic home monitoring system. However, if a court
  determines that an alcohol monitoring device utilizing wireless reporting
  technology is reasonably available, the court may require the person to obtain
  such a device during the period of required electronic home monitoring;
  (b) The offender does not reside in the state of Washington; or
  (c) The court determines that there is reason to believe that the offender
  would violate the conditions of the electronic home monitoring penalty.
