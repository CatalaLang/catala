### (c) Qualified employee discount defined
 For purposes of this section—

#### (1) Qualified employee discount

The term “qualified employee discount” means any employee discount with respect
to qualified property or services to the extent such discount does not exceed—
(A) in the case of property, the gross profit percentage of the price at which
the property is being offered by the employer to customers, or

```catala
scope QualifiedEmployeeDiscount :
  definition qualified_employee_discount
    under condition is_property consequence
  equals
    if employee_discount >$
      customer_price *$ gross_profit_percentage
    then customer_price *$ gross_profit_percentage
    else employee_discount
```

(B) in the case of services, 20 percent of the price at which the services are
being offered by the employer to customers.

```catala
scope QualifiedEmployeeDiscount :
definition qualified_employee_discount
  under condition is_services consequence
equals
  if employee_discount >$
    customer_price *$ 20%
  then customer_price *$ 20%
  else employee_discount

scope QualifiedEmployeeDiscount under condition is_services:
    # When selling a service, one does not need the aggregate cost.
    # We provide a default value here so that the computations run smooth.
    definition aggregate_cost equals $0
    definition gross_profit_percentage equals 0%
```

#### (2) Gross profit percentage

##### (A) In general

The term “gross profit percentage” means the percent which—

(i) the excess of the aggregate sales price of property sold by the employer
to customers over the aggregate cost of such property to the employer, is of

(ii) the aggregate sale price of such property.

```catala
scope QualifiedEmployeeDiscount under condition is_property:
  assertion customer_price >=$ aggregate_cost

  definition gross_profit_percentage equals
    (customer_price -$ aggregate_cost) /$ customer_price
```

##### (B) Determination of gross profit percentage

Gross profit percentage shall be determined on the basis of—

(i) all property offered to customers in the ordinary course of the line of
business of the employer in which the employee is performing services (or a
reasonable classification of property selected by the employer), and

(ii) the employer’s experience during a representative period.

```catala
# (i) and (ii) are subjective criteria for determining the gross profit
# percentage ; we do not formalize them
```

##### (3) Employee discount defined

The term “employee discount” means the amount by which—

(A) the price at which the property or services are provided by the employer to
an employee for use by such employee, is less than

(B) the price at which such property or services are being offered by the
employer to customers.

```catala
scope QualifiedEmployeeDiscount:
  assertion customer_price >=$ employee_price

  definition employee_discount equals
    customer_price -$ employee_price
```

##### (4) Qualified property or services

The term “qualified property or services” means any property (other than real
property and other than personal property of a kind held for investment) or
services which are offered for sale to customers in the ordinary course of
the line of business of the employer in which the employee is performing
services.

```catala
# Again, this is for subjectively determining what item qualifies for a
# discount, not formalizing
```
