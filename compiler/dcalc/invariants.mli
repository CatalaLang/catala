val check_all_invariants : typed program -> bool
(** Check all invariants. Return true if all the invariants are correct. Print
    errors messages for each unsucessfull invariants. Here are all the
    invariants checked:

    - [invariant_default_no_arrow] check no default term has a function type.
    - [invariant_no_partial_evaluation] check there is no partial function.
    - [invariant_no_return_a_function] check no function return a function.
    - [invariant_app_inversion] : if the term is an function application, then
      there is only 6 possibility : it is a let binding, it is an operator
      application, it is an variable application, it is a struct access function
      application (sub-scope call), it is a operator application with trace, or
      an external function.
    - [invariant_match_inversion] : if a term is a match, then every branch is
      an function abstraction.
    - [invariant_typing_default]: the type TDefault can only appear in some
      positions.

    The function prints as a side effect the different errors.*)
