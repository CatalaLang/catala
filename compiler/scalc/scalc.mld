{0 Statement calculus}

This representation is the sixth in the compilation chain
(see {{: index.html#architecture} Architecture}). Its main difference
with the previous {{: Lcalc.html} default calculus} is the switch to a
statement-based language. This representation does not assume any scoping
rules in the language, every local variable has a unique id.
