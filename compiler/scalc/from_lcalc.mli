          Scalc AST nodes for higher-order operators like map, fold,
          handle_default, etc. This is useful if the target language after Scalc
          does not support nested functions like C. *)

      (** When [dead_value_assignment] is true, the translation inserts dummy
          assignments of the variable being defined in the current code branch
          just before raising a terminal error. This is useful for languages
          like Python and their linting tools like mypy. The assignment uses the
          polymorphic [Ast.dead_value]. *)

      (** When [no_struct_literals] is true, the translation inserts a temporary
          variable to hold the initialization of struct literals. This matches
