(** In the following functions, the [~leave_unresolved] labeled parameter
    controls the behavior of the typer in the case where polymorphic expressions
    are still found after typing: if set to [true], it allows them (giving them
    [TAny] and losing typing information), if set to [false], it aborts. *)

(** Infers and marks the types for the given expression. If [typ] is provided,
    it is assumed to be the outer type and used for inference top-down.

    If the input expression already has type annotations, the full inference is
    still done, but with unification with the existing annotations at every
    step. This can be used for double-checking after AST transformations and
    filling the gaps ([TAny]) if any. Use [Expr.untype] first if this is not
    what you want.

    Note that typing also transparently performs disambiguation of constructors:
    [EDStructAccess] nodes are translated into [EStructAccess] with the suitable
    structure and field idents (this only concerns [desugared] expressions). *)

(** Same as [expr], but doesn't annotate the returned expression. Equivalent to
    [Typing.expr |> Expr.untype], but more efficient. This can be useful for
    type-checking and disambiguation (some AST nodes are updated with missing
    information, e.g. any [TAny] appearing in the AST is replaced) *)

    Any existing type annotations are checked for unification. Use
    [Program.untype] to remove them beforehand if this is not the desired
    behaviour. *)
