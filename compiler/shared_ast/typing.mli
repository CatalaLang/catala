  val empty : ?fail_on_any:bool -> ?assume_op_types:bool -> decl_ctx -> 'e t
  (** The [~fail_on_any] labeled parameter controls the behavior of the typer in
      the case where polymorphic expressions are still found after typing: if
      [false], it allows them (giving them [TAny] and losing typing
      information); if set to [true] (the default), it aborts.

      The [~assume_op_types] flag (default false) ignores the expected built-in
      types of polymorphic operators, and will assume correct the type
      information included in [EAppOp] nodes. This is useful after
      monomorphisation, which changes the expected types for these operators. *)

val expr :

  ?typ:typ ->
  (('a, 'm) gexpr as 'e) ->
  ('a, typed) boxed_gexpr
(** Infers and marks the types for the given expression. If [typ] is provided,
    it is assumed to be the outer type and used for inference top-down.

    If the input expression already has type annotations, the full inference is
    still done, but with unification with the existing annotations at every
    step. This can be used for double-checking after AST transformations and
    filling the gaps ([TAny]) if any. Use [Expr.untype] first if this is not
    what you want.

    Note that typing also transparently performs the following changes to the
    AST nodes, outside of typing annotations:
    - disambiguation of constructors: [EDStructAccess] nodes are translated into
      [EStructAccess] with the suitable structure and field idents (this only
      concerns [desugared] expressions).
    - disambiguation of structure names in [EDStructAmend] nodes ([desugared] as
      well)
    - resolution of tuple size (when equal to 0) on [ETupleAccess] nodes
    - resolution of operator types, which are stored (monomorphised) back in the
      [EAppOp] nodes
    - resolution of function application input types on the [EApp] nodes, when
      that was originally empty ([[]]): this documents the arity of the function
      application, taking de-tuplification into account.
    - [TAny] appearing within nodes are refined to more precise types, e.g. on
      `EAbs` nodes (but be careful with this, it may only work for specific
      structures of generated code ; having [~fail_on_any:true] set in the
      environment (this is the default) checks that it didn't cause problems) *)

val check_expr :

  ?typ:typ ->
  (('a, 'm) gexpr as 'e) ->
  ('a, untyped) boxed_gexpr
(** Same as [expr], but doesn't annotate the returned expression. Equivalent to
    [Typing.expr |> Expr.untype], but more efficient. This can be useful for
    type-checking and disambiguation (some AST nodes are updated with missing
    information, e.g. any [TAny] appearing in the AST is replaced) *)

val program :
  ?fail_on_any:bool ->
  ?assume_op_types:bool ->
  ?internal_check:bool ->
  ('a, 'm) gexpr program ->
  ('a, typed) gexpr program
(** Typing on whole programs (as defined in Shared_ast.program, i.e. for the
    later dcalc/lcalc stages).

    Any existing type annotations are checked for unification. Use
    [Program.untype] to remove them beforehand if this is not the desired
    behaviour.

    If [internal_check] is set to [true], typing errors will be marked as
    internal, and the faulty program will be printed if '--debug' is set. *)
