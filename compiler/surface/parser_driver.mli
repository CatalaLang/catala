val lines :
  File.t -> Cli.backend_lang -> (string * Lexer_common.line_token) Seq.t
(** Raw file parser that doesn't interpret any includes and returns the flat law
    structure as is *)

val load_interface : Cli.input_src -> Ast.interface
(** Reads only declarations in metadata in the supplied input file, and only
    keeps type information. The list of submodules is initialised with names
    only and empty contents. *)

val parse_top_level_file : Cli.input_src -> Ast.program
(** Parses a catala file (handling file includes) and returns a program.
    Interfaces of the used modules are returned empty, use [load_interface] to
    fill them. *)
