(** This module performs environment-passing style closure conversion, relying
    on the existential [TClosureEnv] type and tuples for closure environments.
    The implementation is based on FranÃ§ois Pottier's
    {{:http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/mpri/cours04.pdf#page=10} MPRI lesson}.
    After closure conversion, closure hoisting is perform and all closures end
    up as toplevel definitions. *)
