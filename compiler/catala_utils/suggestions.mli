val levenshtein_distance : string -> string -> int
(** [levenshtein_distance w1 w2] computes the levenshtein distance separating
    [w1] from [w2]. *)

val best_candidates : string list -> string -> string list
(** [best_candidates suggestions word] returns the subset of elements in
    [suggestions] that minimize the levenshtein distance to [word]. Multiple
    candidates that have a same distance is possible. *)

val sorted_candidates :
  ?max_elements:int -> string list -> string -> string list
(** [sorted_candidates ?max_elements suggestions word] sorts the [suggestions]
    list and retain at most [max_elements] (defaults to 5). This list is ordered
    by their levenshtein distance to [word], i.e., the first elements are the
    most similar. *)
