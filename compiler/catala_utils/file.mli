(** Utility functions used for file manipulation. *)

val with_out_channel : t -> (out_channel -> 'a) -> 'a
(** Runs the given function with the provided file opened, ensuring it is
    properly closed afterwards. May raise just as [open_out]. *)

val with_in_channel : t -> (in_channel -> 'a) -> 'a
(** Runs the given function with the provided file opened, ensuring it is
    properly closed afterwards. May raise just as [open_in]. *)

(** {2 Formatter wrappers} *)

val with_formatter_of_out_channel :
  out_channel -> (Format.formatter -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [with_formatter_of_out_channel oc f] creates an flushes the formatter used
    in [f] from the given out_channel [oc]. *)

val with_formatter_of_file : t -> (Format.formatter -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [with_formatter_of_file filename f] manages the formatter created from the
    file [filename] used in [f] -- i.e. closes the corresponding out_channel and
    flushes the formatter. *)

val with_formatter_of_opt_file : t option -> (Format.formatter -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [with_formatter_of_opt_file filename_opt f] manages the formatter created
    from the file [filename_opt] if there is some (see
    {!with_formatter_of_file}), otherwise, uses the [Format.std_formatter]. *)

  unit ->
  t option * ((out_channel -> 'a) -> 'a)
(** [get_output ~source_file ~output_file ?ext ()] returns the inferred filename
    and its corresponding [with_out_channel] function. If the [output_file] is
    equal to [Some "-"] returns a wrapper around [stdout]. *)

  t option * ((Format.formatter -> 'a) -> 'a)
(** [get_output_format ~source_file ~output_file ?ext ()] returns the inferred
    filename and its corresponding [with_formatter_of_out_channel] function. If
    the [output_file] is equal to [Some "-"] returns a wrapper around [stdout]. *)

val temp_file : string -> string -> t
(** Like [Filename.temp_file], but registers the file for deletion at program
    exit unless Cli.debug_flag is set. *)

val with_temp_file : string -> string -> ?contents:string -> (t -> 'a) -> 'a
(** Creates a temp file (with prefix and suffix like [temp_file], optionally
    with the given contents, for the lifetime of the supplied function, then
    remove it unconditionally *)

val contents : t -> string
(** Reads the contents of a file as a string *)

val process_out : ?check_exit:(int -> unit) -> string -> string list -> string
(** [process_out cmd args] executes the given command with the specified
    arguments, and returns the stdout of the process as a string. [check_exit]
    is called on the return code of the sub-process, the default is to fail on
    anything but 0. *)

val check_directory : t -> t option
(** Checks if the given directory exists and returns it normalised (as per
    [Unix.realpath]). *)

val check_file : t -> t option
(** Returns its argument if it exists and is a plain file, [None] otherwise.
    Does not do resolution like [check_directory]. *)

val check_exec : t -> t
(** Resolves a command:
    - if [t] is a plain name, resolve in PATH
    - if [t] is relative, returns its absolute path
    - fails with an error explaining that [t] was not found *)

val ( / ) : t -> t -> t
(** [Filename.concat]: Sugar to allow writing
    [File.("some" / "relative" / "path")]. As an exception, if the lhs is [.],
    returns the rhs unchanged. *)

val dirname : t -> t
(** [Filename.dirname], re-exported for convenience *)

val ( /../ ) : t -> t -> t
(** Sugar for [Filename.dirname "a" / b] *)

val ( -.- ) : t -> string -> t
(** Extension replacement: chops the given filename extension, and replaces it
    with the given one (which shouldn't contain a dot) *)

val path_to_list : t -> string list
(** Empty elements or current-directory (".") are skipped in the resulting list *)

val equal : t -> t -> bool
(** Case-insensitive string comparison (no file resolution whatsoever) *)

val compare : t -> t -> int
(** Case-insensitive string comparison (no file resolution whatsoever) *)

val format : Format.formatter -> t -> unit
(** Formats a filename in a consistent style, with double-quotes and color (when
    the output supports) *)

module Set : Set.S with type elt = t
module Map : Map.S with type key = t

val scan_tree : (t -> 'a option) -> t -> (t * t list * 'a list) Seq.t
(** Recursively scans a directory for files. Directories or files matching ".*"
    or "_*" are ignored. Unreadable files or subdirectories are ignored with a
    debug message. If [t] is a plain file, scan just that non-recursively.

    The matching results are returned grouped by directory, case-insensitively
    ordered by filename, as a list of non-empty subdirs and a list of extracted
    items. *)

module Tree : sig
  (** A lazy tree structure mirroring the filesystem ; uses the comparison from
      File, so paths are case-insensitive. *)

  type path = t
  (** Alias for [File.t] *)

  type item = F  (** Plain file *) | D of t  (** Directory with subtree *)

  and t = (path * item) Map.t Lazy.t
  (** Contents of a directory, lazily loaded. The map keys are the basenames of
      the files and subdirectories, while the values contain the original path
      (with correct capitalisation) *)

  val empty : t

  val build : path -> t
  (** Lazily builds a [Tree.path] from the files read at [path]. The names in
      the maps are qualified (i.e. they all start with ["path/"]) *)

  val subtree : t -> path -> t
  (** Looks up a path within a lazy tree *)

  val lookup : t -> path -> path option
  (** Checks if there is a matching plain file (case-insensitively) ; and
      returns its path with the correct case if so *)

  val union : t -> t -> t
  (** Merges two trees. In case of conflict, lhs entry wins *)
