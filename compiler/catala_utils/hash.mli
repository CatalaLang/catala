(** Hashes for the identification of modules.

    In contrast with OCaml's basic `Hashtbl.hash`, they process the full depth
    of terms. Any meaningful interface change in a module should only be in hash
    collision with a 1/2^30 probability. *)

type t = private int
(** Native Hasthbl.hash hashes, value is truncated to 30 bits whatever the
    architecture (positive 31-bit integers) *)

type full
(** A "full" hash includes the Catala version and compilation flags, alongside
    the module interface *)

val raw : 'a -> t
(** [Hashtbl.hash]. Do not use on deep types (it has a bounded depth), use
    specific hashing functions. *)

module Op : sig
  val ( ! ) : 'a -> t
  (** Shortcut to [raw]. Same warning: use with an explicit type annotation
      [!(foo: string)] to ensure it's not called on types that are recursive or
      include annotations.

      Hint: we use [!`Foo] as a fancy way to generate constants for
      discriminating constructions *)

  val ( % ) : t -> t -> t
  (** Safe combination of two hashes (non commutative or associative, etc.) *)
end

val option : ('a -> t) -> 'a option -> t
val list : ('a -> t) -> 'a list -> t

val map :
  (('k -> 'v -> t -> t) -> 'map -> t -> t) ->
  ('k -> t) ->
  ('v -> t) ->
  'map ->
  t
(** [map fold_f key_hash_f value_hash_f map] computes the hash of a map. The
    first argument is expected to be a [Foo.Map.fold] function. The result is
    independent of the ordering of the map. *)

val finalise : t -> closure_conversion:bool -> monomorphize_types:bool -> full
(** Turns a raw interface hash into a full hash, ready for printing *)

val to_string : full -> string
val format : Format.formatter -> full -> unit

val of_string : string -> full
(** @raise Failure *)

val external_placeholder : string
(** It's inconvenient to need hash updates on external modules. This string is
    uses as a hash instead for those cases.

    NOTE: This is a temporary solution A future approach could be to have Catala
    generate a module loader (with the proper hash), relieving the user
    implementation from having to do the registration. *)
