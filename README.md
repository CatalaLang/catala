# Catala

Catala is a domain-specific language for deriving
faithful-by-construction algorithms from legislative texts.

## Concepts

Catala is a programming language adapted for socio-fiscal legislative literate programming. By annotating each line of the
legislative text with its meaning in terms of code, one can derive
an implementation of complex socio-fiscal mechanisms that enjoys
a high level of assurance regarding the code-law faithfulness.

Concretely, you have to first gather all the laws, executive orders, previous cases, etc. that contain information about the
socio-fiscal mechanism that you want to implement. Then, you can
proceed to annotate the text article by article, in your favorite
text editor :

</center>

Once your code is complete and tested, you can use the Catala
compiler to produce a lawyer-readable PDF version of your
implementation. The Catala language has been specially designed
in collaboration with law professionals to ensure that the code
can be reviewed and certified correct by the domain experts, which
are in this case lawyers and not programmers.

The Catala language is special because its logical structure mimics
the logical structure of the law. Indeed, the core concept of
"definition-under-conditions" that builds on default logic has been formalized by Professor of Law Sarah Lawsky in her article [A Logic for Statutes](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3088206). The Catala language is the only
programming language to our knowledge that embeds default logic
as a first-class feature, which is why it is the only language
perfectly adapted to literate legislative programming.


## Catala motivating example : French "allocations familiales"

In the `example/allocations_familiales` folder, you will find the
`allocations_familiales.catala` file which contains the
algorithm computing French family benefits. The algorithm consists of annotations to the legislative
texts that define the family benetifs, using the literate programming paradigm. The Catala
compiler can extract from the `.catala` file a lawyer-readable version of the annotated text.

Currently, this lawyer-readable version comes in the form of a LaTeX document.
You will need to have a standard LaTeX distribution installed as well as the
`latexmk` build tool in order to enjoy the automated document generation process.

To get that lawyer-readable version (which is a LaTeX-created) PDF, simply use

    make allocations_familiales

from the repository root, once you have managed to install the
compiler (see below). You can then open `examples/allocations_familiales/allocations_familiales.pdf`

## Languages

The Catala language should be adapted to any legislative text that follows a general-to-specifics statutes order. Therefore, there exists  multiple versions of the Catala surface syntax, adapted to the language of the lefislative text.

Currently, Catala supports English and French legislations via the `--language=en` or `--language=fr` option. Contact the authors
if you are interested in adding support for another language.

## Limitations and disclaimer

### Early stage project

Catala is a research project from Inria, the French National
Research Institute for Computer Science. The compiler is yet very
unstable and lacks most of its features. Currently, it only
parses the surface language to producde the lawyer-readable PDF,
no interpreter or compiler backend is provided.

However, the language is bound to have a complete formal semantics
in the near future. This semantics will guide the compiler
implementation.

## The Catala compiler

### Requirements

The Catala compiler is written using OCaml. To install OCaml on your machine and
if you're running Linux ou MacOS, open a terminal and enter :

    ./install_opam.sh

This will install `opam`, the OCaml dependency manager and the
base OCaml compiler. If you're on Windows, the simplest solution
would be to use Cygwin or the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Catala has been tested
with OCaml version 4.09.1. You can switch to this version by typing :

    opam switch create 4.09.1

or

    opam switch 4.09.1

if this version of OCaml is already installed. Next, install all the build
dependencies with

    make install-dependencies

This should ensure everything is set up for developping on the Catala compiler !

Other features for generation of files and literate programming also require
the following executables to be present

    man2html virtualenv python3 rsync

please install them if they're not here. On a Debian distribution, this can be
done with

    sudo apt install python3-dev python3-setuptools man2html rsync
    sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    sudo python3 -m pip install virtualenv

On ArchLinux :

    sudo pacman -S python-virtualenv man2html rsync

### Installation

The project is distributed as a Dune artifact. Use standard dune commands to build
and install the library. Makefile aliases are here to help you: running

    make build

builds the compiler from its OCaml sources.


#### Generating website assets

The Catala website features assets generated by the Catala compiler. They are
needed to build the website. To produce them, simply run from this repository's
root directory

    ./generate_website_assets.sh <path-to-catala-website>/assets

You will need the `man2html` executable to generate the HTML versions of the man
pages, as well as the `rsync` executable to transfer files (preferred to `cp`)
because it also works with a remote server.

#### Opam package

If you want to install the library as an opam
package, use the following command at the root of the repository:

    opam install ./

You can then can the compiler using the `catala` command.

### Usage

Use `catala --help` to get more information about the command line options available.

## Syntax highlighting

The Catala language also comes with syntax highlighting to
ease program development. The syntax highlighting is done
with the [Iro](https://eeyo.io/iro/) compiler that allows
writing the syntax only once, and then export it to formats
understood by various IDE. Currently, two syntax
highlighting plugins are under version control.

### Atom

To get Catala syntax highlighting in Atom, simply enter from
the root of the repository, depending on the language you want to use :

    make atom_fr
or

    make atom_en

You can now reload Atom and check that you have syntax highlighting on any `.catala` file.

### Pygments

Pygments is a Python-based versatile lexer for various
programming languages. To use a version of Pygments
augmented with the Catala plugin, simply enter

    make pygments

This will execute the
script `syntax_highlighting/fr/pygments/set_up_pygments.sh` and `syntax_highlighting/en/pygments/set_up_pygments.sh`.

The scripts set up a virtual environement in
`syntax_highlighting/fr/pygments/pygments/env` or
`syntax_highlighting/en/pygments/pygments/env`, which will
contain the modified version of Pygments that has Catala
support. If you want to hack something, it is possible to use this virtual
environnement directly with

    source syntax_highlighting/fr/pygments/pygments/env/bin/activate

or

    source syntax_highlighting/en/pygments/pygments/env/bin/activate

The `pigmentize` executable, used for instance by the `minted` LaTeX package,
will now point to the Catala-enabled version inside the virtual environment.
This `source` setup is not necessary if you use the rules in the `Makefile`.

## Pierre Catala

The language is named after Pierre Catala, a professor of law who
pionneered the French legaltech by creating a computer database of law cases,
Juris-Data. The research group that he led in the late 1960s, the
Centre d’études et de traitement de l’information juridique (CETIJ),
has also influenced the creation by state conselor Lucien Mehl of the
Centre de recherches et développement en informatique juridique (CENIJ),
which eventually transformed into the entity managing the LegiFrance website,
acting as the public service of legislative documentation.
