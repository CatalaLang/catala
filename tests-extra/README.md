This directory is similar to /tests, but contains tests that require extra
dependencies (pandoc, pygments, z3...) and are specific to a given tool
(`literate`, `proof`).

The tests here are irrelevant to backend tests, and don't need to be run with
all the variants of options (`-O`, `--lcalc`, etc.)
