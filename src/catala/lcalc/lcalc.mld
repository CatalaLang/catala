{0 Lambda calculus}

This representation is the fifth in the compilation chain
(see {{: index.html#architecture} Architecture}). Its main difference
with the previous {{: Lcalc.html} default calculus} is the absence of the
default term, which has been eliminated through diverse compilation schemes.

The module describing the abstract syntax tree is:

{!modules: Lcalc.Ast}

This intermediate representation corresponds to the lambda calculus
presented in the {{: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03198} Catala formalization}.

{1 Compilation from default calculus }

Related modules:

{!modules: Lcalc.Compile_with_exceptions}

{!module: Lcalc.Compile_with_exceptions} compiles the default term of the
default calculus using catchable exceptions. This compilation scheme has been
certified.

{1 OCaml backend}

Related modules:

{!modules: Lcalc.To_ocaml}

The OCaml backend of the lambda calculus is merely a syntactic formatting,
since the core of the OCaml value language is effectively a lambda calculus.
